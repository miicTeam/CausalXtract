This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. \
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. \
\
This demo reproduces the pipeline described in the CausalXtract publication. \
\
Before executing this demo, please ensure that the following prerequisites are met: \
- Matlab R2022b is installed (needed for the CellHunterPlus module) \
- the Matlab toolboxes "Image Processing Toolbox" and "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox" are installed \
\ \ Note that you can skip the CellHunterPlus part if you don't have Matlab \
- R and C++14 are installed (needed for the causal discovery module) \
- the CausalXtract github repository has been replicated locally \
- the "MATLAB DATA.rar" file from "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7755700"\
\ \ has been downloaded and extracted \
  in the CausalXtract repository that has been replicated locally.\
\
Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.\ 

```{r}
cat ("CausalXtract Demo\n")
```

Prerequisites check:

```{r}
if ( ! (  dir.exists ("../CellHunterPlus")
       && dir.exists ("../Demo")
       && dir.exists ("../tMIIC") ) ) 
  stop ("CausalXtract repository not found")
if ( ! dir.exists ("../MATLAB DATA") )
  stop ("MATLAB data not found")
cat ("Prerequisites checked\n")
```

We ensure that the causal discovery module (tMIIC) is installed with the needed
R packages:

```{r}
# Check and install if needed the R packages used by tMIIC
if ( ! ("ppcor" %in% installed.packages()) )
  install.packages ("ppcor") 
if ( ! ("Rcpp" %in% installed.packages()) )
  install.packages ("Rcpp") 
if ( ! ("scales" %in% installed.packages()) )
  install.packages ("scales") 
if ( ! ("stats" %in% installed.packages()) )
  install.packages ("stats") 
# Check and install tMIIC
if  (  ( ! ("miic" %in% installed.packages()) )
    || (packageVersion("miic") < "2.0.0") ) 
  install.packages ("miic", repos="./tMIIC") 
cat ("End of R packages check/installation\n")
```

Here, we execute the CellHunterPlus module to perform segmentation & tracking, followed by the feature extraction part. \
(could take some time depending on your hardware !) \
You can skip this part if you don't have Matlab. \

```{r}
cat ("CellHunterPlus module\n")
system("matlab -r \"run('./CausalXtract_CellHunterPlus_Demo_Part.m'); exit\"")

```

Once the features have been extracted, we can run the temporal causal discovery \
(again, this could take some time depending on your hardware !)

```{r}
library (miic)
data <- read.table ("./CausalXtract_Publication_Dataset.tsv", 
                    sep="\t", header=T)
so <- read.table ("./CausalXtract_publication_State_Order.tsv", 
                    sep="\t", header=T)
# res <- miic (input_data=data, state_order=so, tau=11, delta_tau=5,
#              latent="orientation", n_shuffles = 100, conf_threshold=0.01,
#              ori_proba_ratio=0.01, n_threads=8)
res <- miic (covidCases, tau=2, movavg=7, n_threads=8)
```

Plotting is available with several displays:

```{r}
if  ( ! ("igraph" %in% installed.packages()) )
  install.packages ("igraph") 
plot (res)
plot (res, display="raw")
plot (res, display="lagged")
```

An alternate way to execute the causal discovery module is to use the online server
at <https://miic.curie.fr/workbench_timeseries.php>, providing the same parameters
and inputs: dataset file, state_order file, tau=11, delta_tau=5, activate the
skeleton cut with number of shufflings=100 + confidence cut=0.01 and orientation
confidence cut=0.01.
